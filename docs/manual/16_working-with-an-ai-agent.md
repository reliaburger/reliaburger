# Working with an AI agent

An LLM agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and the rest) drives a cluster
through the same `relish` you do. It just reads the output differently. A
table lined up for your eyes is guesswork for a model, a TUI is a dead end,
and an exit code that means "warnings" in one command and "usage error" in
another sends it chasing the wrong problem. `relish agent` is the family of
commands built for it.

This chapter grows through 0.2.7 as the commands arrive (#1090). Today it has
the contract every one of them follows, and the first two commands.

## The contract

Every `relish agent` command:

- prints exactly one line of JSON on stdout, the `relish.agent/v1` envelope,
  success or failure;
- never prompts, never opens a TUI and never reads stdin, so it runs the same
  in a script, a CI job or an agent's tool call;
- stays within a byte budget, 24 KiB unless you pass `--max-bytes`;
- exits with a code that says whether it answered, not what the answer was.

`-o` is accepted and ignored: there's only one format.

## The envelope

An answer looks like this (one line on stdout, spread out here):

```json
{
  "schema": "relish.agent/v1",
  "command": "version",
  "ok": true,
  "relish": {"version": "0.2.7", "commit": "a1b2c3d4…", "dirty": null, "source_digest": null},
  "data": {"version": "0.2.7", "commit": "a1b2c3d4…", "target": "aarch64-apple-darwin",
           "formats": {"protocol": 57, "state": 74}},
  "truncated": false,
  "next": [],
  "warnings": []
}
```

- `relish` says which build answered. `dirty` and `source_digest` are `null`
  until the binary carries its own source bundle, later in 0.2.7.
- `data` is the answer. Its shape depends on the command; `relish agent
  schema` prints it.
- `next` lists commands worth running next. Each has `run` (the command line),
  `why`, and `read_only`. A step with `read_only: false` changes something, so
  an agent should ask you before running it.
- `warnings` are things worth knowing that aren't the answer.

Keys come out in alphabetical order. Every key is always there; a value
nobody knows is `null`.

A failure carries `error` instead of `data`:

```json
{
  "schema": "relish.agent/v1",
  "command": "version",
  "ok": false,
  "relish": {"version": "0.2.7", "commit": "a1b2c3d4…", "dirty": null, "source_digest": null},
  "error": {"code": "unreachable", "message": "bun agent not reachable at localhost:9117 (is it running?)",
            "endpoint": null, "status": null,
            "hint": "start a cluster (relish setup --quickstart) or point at one with --endpoint"}
}
```

`code` is one of a fixed list: `usage`, `no_endpoint`, `unreachable`, `dns`,
`tls_untrusted`, `timeout`, `unauthenticated`, `forbidden`, `not_found`,
`conflict`, `api`, `source_mismatch`, `build_failed`, `unsupported_platform`
and `internal`. `status` is the HTTP status when the API answered with one.

A usage error is an envelope too. Give `relish agent version` a flag it
doesn't have and it prints a failure with the `usage` code on stdout, not
clap's text on stderr. Only `--help` prints ordinary help.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | The command answered. Read `data`. |
| `2` | Usage: a wrong command, flag or value (`usage`). |
| `3` | Couldn't reach or authenticate to the cluster (`no_endpoint`, `unreachable`, `dns`, `tls_untrusted`, `timeout`, `unauthenticated`). |
| `4` | The cluster refused: the token's role or a policy (`forbidden`). |
| `5` | Anything else. |

A command that finds three critical problems still exits `0`: it answered,
and the verdict is in `data`. That's the difference from `relish wtf`, whose
exit code is the verdict.

## Byte budgets

When an answer is bigger than the budget, `relish agent` trims it and keeps
the JSON valid. It drops items from the end of the longest arrays in `data`
first (commands put what matters most at the front), then shortens long
strings, which end in `…[cut]`. Then it says so:

- `truncated` is `true`;
- a warning names each cut, such as `/data/apps: kept 34 of 200 items`;
- the first `next` step runs the same command with a `--max-bytes` big
  enough for the whole answer.

```sh
relish agent schema --max-bytes 4096
```

`--max-bytes` takes at least 1024. An answer that can't be trimmed to fit
(it's mostly fields, not lists) becomes a `usage` failure whose hint names
the budget that would fit.

## Commands

`relish agent version` prints the version, commit, target and cluster formats
of this binary:

```sh
relish agent version
```

`relish agent schema` prints the JSON Schema of the envelope and of every
command's `data`; name a command to get only its schema:

```sh
relish agent schema version
```

The commands that read the cluster (`context`, `diagnose`, `logs`) and the
source this binary was built from (`source`) come next.
