# Finding Friends

Your orchestrator runs on one machine. If that machine dies, everything dies with it. Your health checks keep containers alive on a single node, but they can't do anything about the node itself catching fire. You need more nodes.

This chapter turns Reliaburger from a single-node agent into a cluster. By the end, nodes will discover each other through a gossip protocol, elect a leader through Raft consensus, and distribute workloads across the cluster through a scheduler. It's the biggest architectural leap in the project.

We'll build three communication layers, each operating at a different scale:

1. **Mustard** — a gossip protocol based on SWIM, running on every node (up to 10,000). Handles membership discovery, failure detection, and metadata propagation.
2. **Raft** — consensus protocol running on a small council of 3–7 nodes. Handles leader election and replication of desired state (app specs, scheduling decisions).
3. **Hierarchical reporting tree** — worker nodes report runtime state to council members, who aggregate it for the leader. Keeps variable-size data off the gossip mesh.

Why three layers? Because a single protocol can't efficiently serve both 10,000 nodes and strong consistency. Gossip scales beautifully but gives you eventual consistency. Raft gives you strong consistency but only works with a handful of nodes. So we use gossip for the wide layer and Raft for the narrow one, then add the reporting tree to avoid bloating gossip messages with runtime state.

## Shared types

Before we write any protocol code, we need a shared vocabulary. The scheduler, gossip layer, and Raft module all talk about nodes, apps, and resources. If we let each module define its own types, we'll spend more time converting between them than doing useful work.

### Newtypes: NodeId vs InstanceId

In Chapter 1 we introduced `InstanceId` — a newtype wrapping `String` that identifies a container instance on a node. Now we need `NodeId` to identify nodes in the cluster. Both are strings underneath, but they mean completely different things. Rust's type system prevents us from accidentally passing one where the other is expected.

```rust
/// Unique identifier for a node in the cluster.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Hash, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct NodeId(pub String);
```

Compare this to `InstanceId` from Chapter 1:

```rust
/// Unique identifier for a workload instance on this node.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Hash, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct InstanceId(pub String);
```

Same pattern, different derives. `NodeId` has `Ord` and `PartialOrd` because we'll need to sort nodes for deterministic council selection. It also has `Serialize` and `Deserialize` because node identities cross the wire in gossip messages and Raft entries. `InstanceId` doesn't need any of that — it lives entirely within a single node.

This is the `Newtype(pub Inner)` pattern. The `pub` on the inner field means callers can still access the raw string when they need to (for logging, display, serialisation). But they can't accidentally use a `NodeId` where an `InstanceId` is expected. The compiler catches it.

If you've used Go, you'd get something similar with `type NodeId string` — except Go's type aliases are structurally typed, so you can still pass a plain `string` where a `NodeId` is expected without a cast. Rust won't let you.

### AppId: namespace-qualified identity

Apps need identifiers too, but a bare name isn't enough. Two teams might both deploy an app called "web" in different namespaces. So `AppId` combines the name and namespace:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Hash, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct AppId {
    pub name: String,
    pub namespace: String,
}
```

This is a struct rather than a newtype because identity comes from two fields, not one. We derive `Hash` and `Eq` so it can be used as a `HashMap` key, and `Ord` for deterministic iteration in `BTreeMap`.

### Resources: the currency of scheduling

The scheduler needs to reason about CPU, memory, and GPUs. We represent these as a single struct with saturating arithmetic:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Resources {
    pub cpu_millicores: u64,
    pub memory_bytes: u64,
    pub gpus: u32,
}
```

The key method is `fits()`:

```rust
impl Resources {
    pub fn fits(&self, required: &Resources) -> bool {
        self.cpu_millicores >= required.cpu_millicores
            && self.memory_bytes >= required.memory_bytes
            && self.gpus >= required.gpus
    }
}
```

All arithmetic is saturating — `saturating_sub` and `saturating_add` — because scheduling calculations should never overflow or underflow. If a node has 4000m of CPU and you subtract 5000m, you get 0, not a panic. This is a deliberate design choice: the scheduler should degrade gracefully under overcommit, not crash.

Why `Copy`? `Resources` is 20 bytes (two `u64`s and a `u32`). That's small enough to copy cheaply, and it makes the code much cleaner — no borrowing gymnastics when passing resource values around in scheduling calculations.

### NodeCapacity: what a node can offer

The scheduler doesn't just need to know what a node *has*. It needs to know what's *available*:

```rust
pub struct NodeCapacity {
    pub node_id: NodeId,
    pub address: SocketAddr,
    pub total: Resources,
    pub reserved: Resources,
    pub allocated: Resources,
    pub labels: BTreeMap<String, String>,
}

impl NodeCapacity {
    pub fn allocatable(&self) -> Resources {
        self.total
            .saturating_sub(&self.reserved)
            .saturating_sub(&self.allocated)
    }
}
```

`allocatable = total - reserved - allocated`. The `reserved` portion is for the OS and the Bun agent itself (you don't want the scheduler filling a node so completely that the agent can't function). The `allocated` portion tracks what's already been assigned to workloads. The difference is what's left for new placements.

Labels are stored in a `BTreeMap` rather than a `HashMap` because we need deterministic serialisation. When the scheduler evaluates placement constraints like `region = "us-east"`, it needs to iterate labels in a consistent order across all nodes.

## The SWIM gossip protocol

Now for the interesting part. How do 10,000 nodes discover each other, detect failures, and propagate information — without a central registry?

The answer is SWIM: Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Membership. The name is a mouthful, but the idea is elegant. Each node periodically pings a random peer. If the peer responds, great. If it doesn't, ask a few other nodes to try. If nobody can reach it, mark it suspect, and eventually declare it dead. Information about these state changes piggybacks on the ping/ack messages that are already flowing, so there's no extra network overhead.

### Node states

Every node in the cluster is in one of four states:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum NodeState {
    Alive,
    Suspect,
    Dead,
    Left,
}
```

The transitions look like this:

```text
Alive ──> Suspect ──> Dead
  ▲          │
  └──────────┘  (refutation with higher incarnation)

Any ──> Left  (graceful departure)
```

`Alive` → `Suspect` happens when a node fails to respond to probes. `Suspect` → `Dead` happens after a timeout with no refutation. And `Suspect` → `Alive` happens when the suspected node hears about the suspicion and refutes it by bumping its incarnation number.

`Left` is special — it's a graceful departure. When a node shuts down cleanly, it announces "I'm leaving" and that overrides everything. Once a node has left, even a higher incarnation number can't bring it back.

### Incarnation numbers and conflict resolution

Here's the problem with distributed failure detection: information travels at the speed of gossip, and different nodes might have different views of the world at any given moment. Node A thinks Node B is alive. Node C thinks Node B is suspect. Who's right?

SWIM solves this with incarnation numbers. Each node maintains a monotonically increasing incarnation counter. When a node hears it's been suspected, it increments its incarnation and announces "I'm alive at incarnation N+1." The higher incarnation wins.

```rust
pub fn resolve_conflict(
    old_state: NodeState,
    old_incarnation: u64,
    new_state: NodeState,
    new_incarnation: u64,
) -> (NodeState, u64) {
    // Left is terminal
    if new_state == NodeState::Left {
        return (NodeState::Left, new_incarnation);
    }
    if old_state == NodeState::Left {
        return (NodeState::Left, old_incarnation);
    }

    if new_incarnation > old_incarnation {
        (new_state, new_incarnation)
    } else if new_incarnation < old_incarnation {
        (old_state, old_incarnation)
    } else {
        // Equal incarnation: more severe state wins
        if new_state.dissemination_priority() >= old_state.dissemination_priority() {
            (new_state, new_incarnation)
        } else {
            (old_state, old_incarnation)
        }
    }
}
```

Three rules:
1. Higher incarnation always wins.
2. At equal incarnation, the more severe state wins (`Dead > Suspect > Alive`).
3. `Left` always wins — graceful departure is final.

Rule 2 is important. If two updates arrive with the same incarnation — say, one marking a node Suspect and one marking it Alive — the Suspect update wins. This biases the protocol towards detecting failures rather than missing them. A false positive (marking a healthy node as suspect) is recoverable: the node just bumps its incarnation. A false negative (thinking a dead node is alive) isn't.

### The membership table

Each node maintains a local copy of every known member's state:

```rust
pub struct MembershipTable {
    members: HashMap<NodeId, NodeMembership>,
}
```

`NodeMembership` carries everything we know about a peer:

```rust
pub struct NodeMembership {
    pub node_id: NodeId,
    pub address: SocketAddr,
    pub state: NodeState,
    pub incarnation: u64,
    pub first_seen: Instant,
    pub last_ack: Instant,
    pub resources: Option<ResourceSummary>,
    pub labels: BTreeMap<String, String>,
    pub is_council: bool,
    pub is_leader: bool,
}
```

The table provides query methods that filter by state — `alive_members()`, `active_members()` (alive + suspect), `council_members()`, `leader()`. Each is a simple filter over the `HashMap`. Dead and left nodes stick around temporarily (so their state can be disseminated to nodes that haven't heard yet), then get cleaned up by `reap_dead()`.

One subtlety: when we receive a gossip update about a node we've never seen, we only add it if the state is `Alive`. We don't add unknown dead nodes — what would be the point? This prevents the table from accumulating records of nodes that died before we joined the cluster.

### Piggyback dissemination

SWIM doesn't use dedicated broadcast messages. Instead, membership updates piggyback on the PING/ACK messages that are already flowing. Each message carries up to `MAX_PIGGYBACK_UPDATES` (8) updates, and each update is broadcast `ceil(log2(cluster_size))` times before it expires.

Why `ceil(log2(N))`? Because SWIM's mathematical properties guarantee that an update will reach every node within O(log N) protocol periods with high probability. For a 10,000-node cluster, that's about 14 broadcasts per update — spread across 500ms protocol intervals, that's 7 seconds for full convergence. Not bad.

The dissemination queue prioritises failure-related updates:

```rust
impl NodeState {
    pub fn dissemination_priority(self) -> u8 {
        match self {
            NodeState::Dead | NodeState::Left => 3,
            NodeState::Suspect => 2,
            NodeState::Alive => 1,
        }
    }
}
```

Dead and suspect updates jump the queue. If the queue is full and we have to choose between telling people about a new join and telling them about a failure, the failure wins. Failure detection is time-sensitive; join announcements can wait.

### Message types

Every gossip message is a single UDP datagram, kept under 1400 bytes to avoid IP fragmentation:

```rust
pub struct GossipMessage {
    pub version: u8,
    pub sender: NodeId,
    pub incarnation: u64,
    pub hmac: [u8; 32],
    pub payload: GossipPayload,
}

pub enum GossipPayload {
    Ping { updates: Vec<MembershipUpdate> },
    PingReq { target: NodeId, requester: NodeId, updates: Vec<MembershipUpdate> },
    Ack { updates: Vec<MembershipUpdate> },
}
```

Three message types, each carrying piggybacked updates. `Ping` is a direct probe. `PingReq` asks a third party to probe on your behalf (the indirect probe). `Ack` is the response. That's the entire protocol vocabulary.

The `hmac` field is zeroed out for now. Phase 4 will fill it in with HMAC-SHA256 computed from the node's mTLS certificate, so nodes can verify that gossip messages are authentic. The field exists from day one so the message format doesn't change later.

### What's next

We have the state machine, the membership table, the message types, and the dissemination queue. In the next section, we'll add the transport layer and the actual SWIM probe cycle — the async loop that drives the whole protocol.
